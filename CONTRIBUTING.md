# Contributing to the Evmos Community Docs

Welcome to the official Evmos Community Docs. This repository will be the living grounds for community learning, events, and engagements. If there are any elements you would like to add to or found some errors and would like to contribute, please be aware of these guidelines below:

1. Make sure when you push a change, you have a clear title and description of what the pull request is resolving. Empty description or incomplete information will delay the pull request in being fully reviewed or merged.
2. Ensure the updates do not have any errors or linting issues.
3. For larger file content, like videos, link the video via a link.
4. Run Docusaurus locally to ensure all the images, content, and markdown are displaying the content as intended.

## Review Process

When submitting a change, please add several reviewers to the pull requests to increase chances of review. Code owner includes `@masterfung`.

Thank you for taking the time to learn about the contribution process.
